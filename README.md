    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>(This should include your name, a photo, your title and a paragraph or two 
        about who you are, what you’ve done, and where you’d like to go next.)</p>
    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>(This should contain a list of projects completed and a few pics, gifs, etc.
        of projects you'd like to highlight to stand out above the rest. Thinking
        that the most complex and projects I should be proud of would be the ones
        involved there)</p>
    <h1>Contact Me</h1>
    <p>(This should have your linkedIn and Github links along with an email to be
        reached at. Any extra notes along with this should be included.)</p>
    <p>Style up this page to show css and personal design feel. Probably should stop
        putting the below stuff in here after I figure out how to blog</p>
    <h1>Short and Concise, Responsive, Custom URL, Make This POP Without Extra Clutter</h1>
