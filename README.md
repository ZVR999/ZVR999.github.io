    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>(This should include your name, a photo, your title and a paragraph or two 
        about who you are, what you’ve done, and where you’d like to go next.)</p>
    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>(This should contain a list of projects completed and a few pics, gifs, etc.
        of projects you'd like to highlight to stand out above the rest. Thinking
        that the most complex and projects I should be proud of would be the ones
        involved there)</p>
    <h1>Contact Me</h1>
    <p>(This should have your linkedIn and Github links along with an email to be
        reached at. Any extra notes along with this should be included.)</p>
    <p>Style up this page to show css and personal design feel. Probably should stop
        putting the below stuff in here after I figure out how to blog</p>
    <h1>Short and Concise, Responsive, Custom URL, Make This POP Without Extra Clutter</h1>
    <h1>Knowledge Addict</h1>  <!--First Heading-->
    <p>That's not a thing right? Lately I've found myself having better days
        as long as I've learned something new AND touched up on something 
        that I've learned before. I.E. I find sites such as <a href="
        https://www.alison.com" target="_blank">
        Alison</a> and try to take a course in anything. Afterwards I'd move
        on to a task that'd require a skill I've learned in the past. Ranging
        from looking to refinance a loan for lower payment and/or rate(this
        one is rare but AWESOME if everything works in my favor), testing out a 
        new cooking or cleaning technique, fun stretch or martial art stance
        for better balance and force placement, etc. Haha, I think I've fell
        into this mind set because of a video game I played call 'Persona 5'.

        <br/>Minus the fictional stuff, that's pretty much all you do in that game.
        Good Stuff.</p><hr>
